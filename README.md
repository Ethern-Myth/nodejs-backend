# Advanced NodeJS RestAPI with MySQL

This backend is created with **NodeJs, Express and Sequelize**.

MySQL is required as the database. Database used was **XAMMP MYSQL through phpmyadmin**.

The concept is to decorate a basic NodeJS to an MVC **(Model-View-Controller)** type. Although the **view** such as html or cshtml in **.NET core** is not present here, the view is the output from the server as **json, xml or text** format.

**Swagger is configured**. Open http://localhost:5000/swagger ; all routes are defined there.

### To begin:
Install dependencies:
```
yarn 
```
Make sure to have MySQL running before:
```
yarn start
```
That's it !!

I hope to add more elements to this in due time. 

**If you made it to this repo. Thank you.**
